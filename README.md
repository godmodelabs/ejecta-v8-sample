# About

This project is a sample app for the ejecta-v8 library (https://github.com/godmodelabs/ejecta-v8).

The library ports the excellent EjectaJS (https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta) to Android, replacing JavascriptCore with v8 in the process. Think of it as a Javascript engine with Canvas and AJAX but no DOM. If you want fast rendering of a cross-platform Canvas-based JS application this is for - if you have a web application or your JS code accesses the DOM in any way a WebView will be a better choice.

You can also download the sample app from Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ag.boersego.bgjs.sample
